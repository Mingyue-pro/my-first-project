# Write a programme that determines the name of a shape from its number of sides. Read the 
# number of sides from the user and then report the appropriate name as part of a meaningful 
# message. Your programme should support shapes with anywhere from 3 to up to (and including) 10 
# sides. If a number of sides outside of this range is entered then your programme should display an 
# appropriate error message.

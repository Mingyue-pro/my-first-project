# A triangle can be classified based on the lengths of its sides as equilateral, isosceles or scalene. All 
# three sides of an equilateral triangle have the same length. And isosceles triangle has two sides that 
# are all the same length and a third side that is a different length. If all of the sides have different 
# lengths then the triangle is scalene.
# Write a programme that reads the lengths of the three sides of a triangle from the user. Then display 
# a message that states the triangleâ€™s type
